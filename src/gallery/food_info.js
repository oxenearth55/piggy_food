        description: 'Me too.  That’s one of the reasons I love hor mok, the Thai curry fish custard.  With its multiple layers,  first of Thai basil and/or cabbage, then succulent chunks of fish, then a complex-tasting curried fish custard, and finally a coconut cream topping garnished with thinly sliced red pepper and kaffir lime leaves, all stacked in a banana leaf fashioned into a bowl and then steamed…. well, it sounds pretty darn complicated to make In fact after deciding I was going to attempt this dish I set aside an entire afternoon, dedicated solely to hor mok making.  But, I was happily surprised that it wasn’t as complicated to make as it sounds.  It was actually done in no time at all.',
